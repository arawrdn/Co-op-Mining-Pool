# Co-op-Mining-Pool
The core function is to allow multiple users to contribute ETH to a common pool. Rewards, in the form of a specified ERC-20 token, are then distributed proportionally based on each participant's ETH contribution. The system utilizes a secure "Pull" mechanism for claiming rewards, ensuring gas efficiency and proper accounting.
